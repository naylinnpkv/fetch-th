# Fetch Take Home Project

## Tech Stack

### Frameworks and Libraries
- **Next.js (TypeScript)**: for its out of the box features and server side rendering (ssr was not possible with the given api setup)
- **Zustand**: State management for it's simplicity and ease of use
- **React Hook Form and Yup Validation**: For managing form state and validation
- **Shad UI**: Chosen for its compatibility with Tailwind CSS and customizability
- **React Select**: For enhanced select components
  
## What Could Be Improved with More Time

### Location-Based Filtering
- Implement filtering based on the user's location preference
- Integrate free-tier geolocation APIs (Here or Google) for:
  - Location validation
  - Easier access to user coordinates

### Test Coverage
Implement testing to ensure:
- useFilterStore updates correctly
- Query parameters and the filter store work together as expected

### Testing Frameworks I would have used
- **Vitest** and **React Testing Library** 

### Additional Features I would add
- implement caching library such as react-query or swr to cache api responses
